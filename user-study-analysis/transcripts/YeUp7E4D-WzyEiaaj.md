\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so just a quick sort of debrief discussion and then we're done. So just overall, how was the task for you guys? Anything surprising? Anything memorable?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: It was nice, I'd say.

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: Fun. I would say surprising at the beginning. I didn't know I was going to build a bridge. You know, I was thinking of doing something in manufacturing or whatever. But building a bridge with another person, it was more fun.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel that we were on the same page during the building task?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: At the beginning it was more complicated, but at the end 100%.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So was there a specific moment when it really clicked for you? Or on the other hand, was there a moment when you had real trouble getting through to the other one?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: I mean, I think it clicked when we aligned on the idea that we can just exploit the system in a way that we should build around and use the floor as a stability measure. And I think that really helped us to align and be more efficient and also yeah feel more confident in our teamwork etc and what was the other one like the what was the moment when you had trouble getting through to the other one i mean when we couldn't talk i think it was harder to communicate but still then i think we just focused on executing the task and i really appreciated petro just uh yeah also aligned a bit on what i was doing and we just did it and it worked in a way

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: even though it wasn't maybe the smartest thing to do we just did it and it worked i think okay um so in terms of contribution and initiative who have you contributed more who have you took the initiative more it wasn't equally distributed how did they go i think felix did a little bit more because he was more skilled with the blocks you know but

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: uh strategy wise i think it was 50 50\.

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: yeah i think we really complemented each other in the way that like when i had an idea petro added another aspect or he had an idea

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: like we could develop it further but to be honest we were very quick in aligning and executing i say we had a common goal and we put our own we put the ideas together in yes um and then uh if you were going to build another bridge tomorrow if you were doing this again tomorrow um what's sort of one thing you want to do differently build

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: it over the obstacles building a bridge no i mean I don't know, I'm very happy the way we executed. I think it would be interesting for us as well to have a very or more complex area with red parts and everything to make the whole task like maybe have the whole floor red and just some spots that are not red you know to really have us build like proper structures. That would be interesting.

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: Stability and cost don't go together you know so the goal at the end of the day was for us to build let's say an efficient way but if you want to make it stable and you know properly you need more time or more strategies or more civil engineering skills okay

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: anything else you want to get into the microphone anything else you want to say get down on the record

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: we are happy to be included in the study. It was well to our spend.

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: Yeah, and we had a lot of fun and yeah, it was a nice thing.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much.
