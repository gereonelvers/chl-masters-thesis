\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Thanks for taking the time to do the user study today. I hope you had at least some amount of fun there. To start things off, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the past today?

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: So we needed to bridge the, build the bridge, and we had three, three, like... constraints are three things that we needed to pay attention to which was first the time then it was second the money and then it was the stability and so we needed to do it together as teamwork um but we also needed to consider these three factors while building um were there any moments in particular where you really

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: enjoyed yourself or you felt really frustrated Can you describe them?

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: Sometimes it felt frustrating when... I wanted to put a block somewhere and it didn't go where I wanted it to go and like that it didn't really like depict it actually like my motor activities you know that was frustrating but with the time that got easier and what I found frustrating was I would have I think stuck to the first building scheme because I thought it was pretty good and it was quite cheap. But I got the point that Leopold wanted to do something new. But I thought if you just consider these three things, because one factor was not like being innovative, it was just being quick, being like these constraints. And then I thought, why just don't we use the same structure again? The question was. what was frustrating right any moments that you particularly enjoyed or where you feel like i mean i would say it was in general quite funny the whole experiment um like it was in general enjoyable um um i think i found the first task the best where we had the three two different roles um Yes.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So would you say then that the first task varied basically stood out the most or is one of them particularly memorable?

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: I think because I found the structure, the way we built the bridge, the assembly, I personally thought it was the best. That's why I'm the most confident and happy with that task. I mean, of course, the task where we had a time limit was quite unsuccessful for us, so I'm not proud of this one. And the last two were a bit random. We didn't really, I feel like, thought thoroughly about something. Yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So then maybe across all four tasks, just in general, in conclusion, how do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: I think Leopold and I, we did quite, like, the teamwork was good between us. And I think we both... listen to each other at the beginning I felt competitive but then I thought like it's not really helpful like being competitive because it's about teamwork and about we are quicker if we both build it together rather than one is trying to build it faster um and yeah but I think he did a good job like of course that with the where we had a time constraint was maybe not the best idea with like removing the staff because i thought that i thought maybe we should just stick with it even though the bridge will be unstable but better than having nothing um yes how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the task did it differ between the variants i think when you assigned the role to us i was a bit more in my role and i was a bit more like confident in what I was saying because I was like okay no I'm the manager on cost so I need to say clearly what we need to do and then where we needed to be quiet I think the non-verbal communication was still good just I think when we had the time pressure task that our communication was not good because we started although we like Leopold actually didn't want it to start and then the timer went on and I think that we should have thought first really what we should do before just trying something and then the timer started and so we should have come up with a plan which we didn't do you feel that your personality or your previous experience played any role in how you collaborated with your partner definitely like that place a huge role um also yeah i mean i as i said like being I mean just like in terms of compromising of like being like okay I get your idea I think we can do that instead of being like very persistent with your own views um it's very decisive in how you how you build something and how successful it can be um but yeah I think like extroversion introversion plays a big part in it because it's teamwork and there it's about how good you communicate with others so i think that's quite decisive like if you're introverted i think maybe you don't express your ideas um as much and you just do what the other partner says or are more likely to do it um and with being like conscientious i think that's also quite a important trait because you plan thoroughly what you want to do you think about it um and agreeableness is also like how well you are um with like working with someone else together how uncomplicated you maybe are um so i think they play a huge role so do you feel um that

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: maybe depending on that as well um you adapted your usual working style to your partner do you do you think leopold adapted his working usual working style to you

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: I think my usual working style is like to express my point of views but still to listen to the other point of views and then I think it's quite important to be agreeable to like have a compromise and to not only be in your old field of view and do what you want to do and I kind of like stuck with it I don't think that I necessarily change it because of Leopold it's because of the way I'm working And I mean, I don't know Leopold that much that I kind of get his pattern of working, but I feel like he had quite a similar working style to me. So he also had his own ideas, but he was also very, like, very agreeable with my ideas and, like, understood what I wanted to do and then also tried to compromise there. So I think we were both on a very good level. without necessarily changing a lot how we normally work i think it also usually works like that yeah switching gears do you feel mentally overloaded at any point um doing any of the variants any of the tasks anytime i actually found it funny a bit because when i did the questionnaires and then when i put the hololens on i was about to pinch the whole dance because i was so in like a pinching mood and yeah because it was really you were in a flow you were a bit under time pressure but in like a good game sense and so that was actually really nice and i think just in the beginning when i didn't really understood how you can select the items there was a bit lost because i really just didn't understand it but overall i would say it was not too mentally straining but i would say it did definitely take like cognitive effort and mental demand but I think in like a sense where it's okay um where also it's productive because you actually think about what you're doing you're trying your best and it did it wasn't boring at all like it was a really good sense of um like um thinking about something but still having fun putting effort in it but in a good way yeah um and across the variants you did.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How would you compare the difficulty of the task across the conditions?

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: You mean the task with the manipulation so that you said, okay, now you have a time constraint and now you don't.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How difficult did you find the task? In general? Just in general and specifically how would you compare that across the different conditions?

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: I think in general the task was quite easy actually because, I mean... of course you had like seven different options i think but of course you didn't need it to or actually maybe it wasn't that easy because you have three factors to think about and with costs i mean we thought about it a bit but we didn't really do the maths i would say it was just like okay that's cheap so let's use that but i mean in terms of efficiency sometimes it's good to use something expensive and then you can use other cheaper things but use one expensive thing um And also, I think actually when I now think about it, like considering all three factors it is quite difficult um especially because you want to do the task also quickly um but i think the fun part of it by doing it with someone else it took a bit the seriousness out of the game out of like the task um yes and um regarding the difference between the conditions. I think actually the open-ended condition was not really my favorite, although I would have thought that initially, but I thought like guidance was actually quite nice to have like assigned roles because I think that helped in like breaking down the factors. Like when it was like, okay, my task is to just look at the costs, not at the three different factors. And his task was to manage the stability and I think that was actually very helpful so that the complexity was the lowest but then I think it increased with the open-endedness because we were just both a bit lost and also the time constraint I think if you would have done it a bit more thoroughly and more well thought than we did so initially talked about it then it would have been completely fine because I think we should have just repeated what we did before and then everything would have worked out um and the fourth one was which one again silent that was fine because we did what we did before almost um yeah

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay and then final final point is there anything else you want to say into the microphone right now any questions comments feedback anything else you want to get on the the record

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: Let me think about it. Let me give you some good data. Yeah, as I said, I think personality does play a big role. And I think, I don't know about Leopold's personality because I don't know him that well. But I think we are quite compatible. So it worked out well. I think we had similar priorities. oh it's just front of the door um and yes and but i think the most important trait actually now when i think about it is being conscientious so um to like plan it well um and after that probably extraversion because of communication um and i think both of us we didn't such an emphasis on being conscientious um yes okay thank you so much thank you
