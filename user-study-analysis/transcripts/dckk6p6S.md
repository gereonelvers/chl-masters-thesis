\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay so thanks for taking the time and doing the user study today um hope it was a good experience overall um can you just briefly talk about or share your overall experience with the task day it was uh straightforward in the beginning we were quite confused because we thought we had to build like this like

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: a common bridge which is like high ground but then we figured out the best way and then in the end it was quite fun and easy okay um what are moments you particularly enjoyed or moments where you felt frustrated

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Can you describe them?

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: I think particularly in the VR or like the XR environment is like something special because you don't experience it so much in your daily work environment. So that's something that's like extraordinary at least. When it comes to the usage of it, it tends to be buggy and the grid is not like really, really aligned to each other. And sometimes you need to click buttons twice or recalibrate twice. So the hardware needs to step up a bit. yeah um was there a particular variant of the task that really stood out they really stood out yeah one of the variants that you like really enjoyed or there was really bad i think the first one just because we were new to the task if we would had to do the first one silent so without talking to each other then this would be like something that would really stand out um and how do you feel about your performance and also how do you feel about your partner's performance I'm quite happy about my partner's performance and I'm also happy about my performance. In the end, we figured out that we could build it even more efficient. I think it was like a gradually learning curve that we exhibited there and therefore I'm quite happy with it.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How would you describe your communication style with your partner during the tasks? Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: Because we choose the same solution for every... different tasks. I think the communication wasn't a big part of it. That's why at some point we were just like trying to do the same thing and then we were like, yeah, okay, a well working team.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel that your personality or previous experience played any role in how you collaborated?

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: It would have been in a way more complex sex probably because we could share way more direct how we would collaborate with each other. But with this task, it was quite fine.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So do you feel that you and your partner communicated well and did you adapt to the other's working style at all?

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: I think we communicated well. In the end we also shared the task with each other. I think that's a good sign of communication. Then we split it that and overall we both had fun and we're going out of here as friends.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel mentally overloaded at any point? If so, when?

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: Probably not because of the task, because everything was quite straightforward. The forms were not too much, so the whole information that you needed to process was quite doable. As I said before, if the task would be more complex, probably then I would have cognitive overload.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And then final question, how would you compare the difficulty of the task across different conditions?

\*\*dckk6p6S\*\*: was there one condition that was one variant that was particularly hard yeah yeah the one where you didn't work where you were not allowed to talk um yeah okay do you have any other questions comments anything else you want to get down on the record um the hardware needs to improve i think that's a that's a major benefit to the user experience overall uh if you want to use it in a really in a real business environment okay well thank you so much
