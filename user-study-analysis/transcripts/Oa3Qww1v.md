\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay so thanks for taking the time and doing the user study um i hope you i hope you had some some amount of fun um as a brief uh sort of introductory question is do you can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today um it was fun

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: and i think it was like very easy to learn how to move things and and stuff for me it was like sort of the first time using this type of system and I find it very easy to like move the buildings. Okay,

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: were there any particular moments you really enjoyed or where you felt really frustrated? Can you describe them?

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: It was a bit frustrating while the task that we need to in which we had the different aims because it was like difficult to interact with the other person and to like find out the most structural way to do it and and it was also a bit difficult because it was not easy also due to the way the red blocks were positioned and the most funny part that I enjoyed the most I don't know It was fun when we weren't able to talk, but for us, like, I don't know, not enjoyable, like, the most funny part.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So was there a particular task variant of the four that really stood out, that was really, like, better or worse than the other ones?

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: I don't know. Maybe we had, like, four. I enjoy when we... had the same aim so maybe like the one in which we were able to talk and with the same aim because i felt like more collaborative task okay um and how do you feel about your performance across all the four tasks and how do you feel about your practice performance across um i think that the performance was not the best in each of the various tasks um about day one in which I had to improve the structural strength of the bridge. I don't think that I've done a great job. And even in the last two, I think that there would have been ways to reduce costs. And about my partner's performance, yes, he managed to not... not to spend so much money in the one in which we had different aims so uh he did better i think in that one and in the other ones i think that in the third one we spent too much money so and he was he wanted to use that blocks so i think he he didn't do well in that task but um and then how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the task did it differ between I mean, we had a good way of collaborating, except for the task in which we had different aims. And yeah, maybe not a great way of collaborating in that task because we spent a lot of time arguing. So not the best.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel that your personality or maybe your previous experiences in whatever played a role in how you collaborated?

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: Yes, I think that the fact that we are both competitive and we are also friends and an influence in it because we wanted to like win over the others.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you or your partner adapt to the other's working style? So based on like how you would usually work for someone, did you change that? Yeah,

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: I think that in the last two tasks, I... follow what he was doing also especially in the one in which we didn't have to talk yeah i just follow him um and did you feel mentally overloaded at any point um if so when uh i mean a bit after the one with different aims because we spent a lot of time arguing but i mean not that much like we're low but a bit like stressed about it.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So would you say then that was the most difficult variant of the task or how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the variants?

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: I think that's the the one in which we were at like different aims was the most difficult one and yes so most difficult and then this as in the second position i will put the one in which we weren't able to talk about like not there is a big difference between the first and the second one and then the other two slightly above the second okay um

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Thank you. Is there anything else you want to say? Anything you want to add? Any other comments you want to get down on the record? No, that's okay. It was really fun. Okay, thank you so much.
