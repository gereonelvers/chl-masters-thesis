\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thanks for taking the time to do the user study today. To start things off, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: The overall experience was great. As I said, we used the Metacrest 3, and I think the HoloLens is better for an AR experience. I find it a little bit difficult that the bricks are moving automatically in the position, so that's a little bit tricky. But overall, I think that's a great, great task to do.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: What are moments you particularly enjoyed or where you particularly felt frustrated? Can you describe them?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: Yeah, I enjoyed particularly the moments where we have to exchange and have the roles because I had the feeling we switched roles and mixed up the roles and we don't put much effort in controlling the costs. Yeah, that was the scenario I enjoyed very much. I felt a little bit frustrated. But as I said that the bricks are moving automatically, so I can't put the cube right in front of the red line, so it moved automatically a little bit away. So that's a little bit annoying, but overall I think that's a good system.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so then was that the particular task variant that sort of stood out the most? Or was there one particular variant you really enjoyed or really didn't like? Or any one of the four variants that particularly stood out?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: I would say the... the role thing I liked very much. And I think, as you said, the order of our task was very good because we can train a little bit in this open scenario. And then was, yeah, no talking and was clear how we do that and how we share the tasks.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, then across all four tasks, how do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: first of all i felt a little bit frustrated of my performance because of the thing i mentioned several times with the bricks moving um but from an overall perspective i'm i'm satisfied with our performance in the whole i think my partner did

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: his best and we were nearly the same on the same level yeah how would you describe your communication style with your partner the difference between the variants

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: So since I know her very good, we're working together, we're colleagues, we're in the same office, and that we had the great order of this task, it was very easy to communicate, especially the part where we're not allowed to talk. So I would say communication was in total very, very good. But I can imagine that if you have a partner, you are not... that familiar with you know only short time then it would be much harder did you feel that your personality or previous experience played a role in how you collaborated i would say it yes because at our university we had also several experiments with ar and vr tasks and we spend like hours together in VR. So I would say we are very familiar. with how to grab things how to move things and how to orient with with this stuff so i would say yeah this this is quite important so what do you say then that communication with your partner went well and did you adopt to the others working adapt to the others working style at all so did you adapt your own working style to their working style did they adapt theirs did we oh that's a good question did we adopt our working styles I would not say adopt because we didn't start and then felt, oh, it does not work. We aligned it right before. I would think, yeah, that's a better word.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel mentally overloaded at any point?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: Yeah, in the first round where I was not that familiar with the system. I would say I had much more mental effort. I was stressed. So how does it work? I had to to try out with this with this menu right on the side and this was very stressful for me um but yeah in the upcoming rounds i know okay there's a little bug or you have to put it like there and yeah the the mental workload i would say um

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: decreased over the time and how would you compare the difficulty across the different conditions across the the variants?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: I would say the difficulty is similar over the conditions. But I would say it's a little bit biased because of the order of our tasks. I can imagine if you have another order as a group, it would be much more harder.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Is there anything else you would like to get done on the record? Any questions? Any other comments? Anything else you want to get transcribed?

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: I would say it's a great experiment. I think you put a lot of effort in it. And no, everything is set, I would say.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much.
