\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thank you so much for taking the time. Overall, how was that experience for you? Anything surprising, anything memorable?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: You want to start? Okay. So as I said before, the overall experience, I think, was really very smooth. Yeah, I think even though I don't have AR experience or VR experience, I think it was very quickly to understand it. And I think we worked quite well in collaboration. And yeah, no big difficulties except for the alignment issues. That's it.

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I agree.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So you feel you were on the same page during the building test across all the variants, you always were on the same page.

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I feel like maybe in the first one we weren't because it was the silent one. But I think if it hadn't been the first one, then we would have been more aligned.

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: Yeah, and even in the one where we had kind of the different positions, it ended up being... I think, in the benefit of both objectives.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So was there a particular moment that you can remember where it really clicked for you or where you had trouble getting through to the other one at all?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I mean, in the first one, maybe it was a bit difficult to get through to the other one. It's just like putting down blocks and you try to think what the other person might, what strategy they might have, but you don't really know it. But with the other ones, I mean, it's... kind of a limited space and you're able to communicate so i think yeah that was really fine.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Who of you contributed more and who of you took the initiative more? Was there any difference there?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I think we contributed equally.

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: Yeah i agree um i think we both kind of agreed very quickly on what we would do instead of because we knew that we had one objective being the time management so i think we just both saw that it was probably the most efficient to just agree on something quite quickly and no one had super out of the box ideas i think we had more kind of straightforward ideas so there wasn't really much discussion about it and i feel like there was initiative from both sides i wouldn't say that one dominated okay and if you were going to build another bridge together tomorrow what's one thing you'd want to do differently is there anything i think our bridges were great um maybe read something about bridge uh static beforehand to know i mean i think i would be really curious about the results of how well these bridges actually hold and then maybe i would make a judgment of how we could have done it better if it's really better to build it very low or if the one that looked most like a bridge is also the one that's maybe that works the best um but one thing i think i would do but I think we already applied kind of throughout the tasks was in the beginning I think we kind of just took the more expensive blocks because it's of course easier if you have the blocks with more parts in it then you kind of get done faster but yeah

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I'm not sure um about static either however I feel like especially our last two bridges um came very close to what i'm used to seeing as a bridge in real life so i think i would try to stick to that um theory of having one road so to say and then supporting blocks beneath it yeah but i don't know if it makes a difference for example because we then had the the

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: single blocks and the ones that we laid over them if that's maybe a an issue because you don't have them kind of connecting and maybe something like an L or a T shape is maybe still more stable because you connect the kind of fundamental. Yeah, we also tried that.

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: You will tell us which one is more stable.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: I'll let you know. Is there anything else you want to get into the microphone? Questions, comments?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: See the bridges.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: I'll show you some of the bridges.

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: We're excited to see the bridges.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.
