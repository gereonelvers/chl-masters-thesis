\chapter{Systematic Literature Review Supporting Materials}
\label{appendix:literature-review}

This appendix provides comprehensive supporting materials for the systematic literature review of collaborative augmented reality (AR) applications in industrial settings. The materials are organized into three main sections: the search methodology, screening process, and detailed coding sheets for the analysis of the 33 included papers.

\chapter{Literature Review Coding Sheets}
\label{appendix:coding-sheets}

This chapter presents the comprehensive coding sheets for the systematic literature review. The coding was conducted across three dimensions corresponding to the research questions, with each of the 33 included papers systematically analyzed and coded. The three coding sheets are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Types of Collaboration} (Section~\ref{appendix:types-collaboration}): Coding related to RQ1, examining application types, collaboration modes, and interaction mechanisms
    \item \textbf{Technical Implementation} (Section~\ref{appendix:technical-implementation}): Coding related to RQ2, examining hardware, software, and technical challenges
    \item \textbf{UX Design Approaches} (Section~\ref{appendix:ux-design}): Coding related to RQ3, examining user experience design patterns and effectiveness
\end{itemize}
