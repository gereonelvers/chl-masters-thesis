\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thanks for doing the user study. I have a couple short interview questions, and then we're going to have a short, debrief discussion after. So could you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: Yes, in general, it was fun working on it, building the bridges, and especially the last task when you had an additional objective. For me, it was that it's as structural integer as possible.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: however like the one thing that was a bit annoying is like when the collaboration didn't work or like we saw different realities or you accidentally like destroyed the bridge because of the way the system handled how you picked up the the parts and stuff but generally it was a great fun okay um was there any particular moments you particularly enjoyed or any time you really felt frustrated can you just describe them um yes

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: so i in general i enjoyed the building process when you thought about how to build the bridges and put together the parts and then it worked and you had a working-ish bridge. What I didn't like was when we saw different realities, when I spawned the parts and then they didn't show up or they showed up as like 20 parts a few seconds later or when stuff just moved out of nowhere, which is also like a little bit.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular task variant that stood out? Why?

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: In being annoying or in being fun?

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: In any way, just any task variant that stood out particularly.

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: I felt like if you had a more challenging obstacle, this was a bit more fun to build a bridge around it, yes.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, how do you feel about your performance then? How do you think you did? How about your partner?

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: I think the initial idea we had about building the bridges using the big blocks and planks is... quite efficient so we had this agreement throughout all the tasks that this is a very efficient baseline bridge so also for the um understanding task that the task where we didn't where we weren't allowed to speak it was very helpful to have this understanding of what a good bridge is and also in the discussion task so we just build a variant of the bridge that is hopefully more more stable but still is the same bridge so i think once you figured out a good base design you can iterate from that and that was worked very well with the partner um how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the task did it differ between the variants um this was i think was very collaborative for all the variants except for the variant where we have different where we had different objectives and then it was a bit more like then we had a few more discussions but i think in general it was still collaborative especially because like my vr didn't work so i had to rely on my my partner for like building the bridge and the compromise we found and i think this was

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: right well as well um did you feel your personality or previous experience played any role in how you collaborated with your partner sorry i do um

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: Yes, so for the VR environment, I knew that things not always work perfectly 100% of the time. So I was quite relaxed when stuff didn't work out or parts didn't spawn where we would expect them to spawn or when we would expect them to spawn. So yeah, this changed. I think if I wouldn't have this experience, I would have been much more... stressed about working with a partner and if she sees something different than I did so I was much more relaxed how did communication with your partner go how well did you communicate and did you adapt to each other's working styles at all um I think we communicated well but I'm not really sure that we could show our own personal working styles because like the way the system worked we just like improvised and like for the person for who the system works best, like took the lead in building and like the other just checked what they were doing. So,

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay. Did you feel mentally overloaded at any point? If so, when?

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: Mentally overloaded? I think it added a lot of mental load when we had to discuss and build the bridge at the same time. Because then you had not only the... like the building process of the bridge and a goal you had to achieve but also like the social strain of being to discuss with you um so then how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions um definitely the the condition where we had to discuss what the was the most difficult because also the obstacle was the largest and you knew you had this like the bridge would be tested for the other examples you could just like build a bridge and said yes it's fine So I think this was definitely more stuff. I mean, also the everything about the task where we weren't allowed to speak was very difficult. But since we knew how the bridge should look like from the first example, this was not as hard. So if we like if this had been our first exercise, this would have been very hard without talking.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Any other thoughts, opinions, anything else you want to share? Anything else you can comment on?

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: No, I don't think so.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Thank you so much.
