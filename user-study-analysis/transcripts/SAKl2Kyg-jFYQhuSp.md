\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, I'm just going to turn on the recording again, just to have some amount of discussion we can also face stuff on. Okay, so welcome back to both of you. Overall, now that you've completed all the four variants, done all the tasks, would you just say, for the both of you, how was that? Anything you liked, anything you didn't like, anything? How did things go for you?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I can start. I really like the tasks and the setting as well. I think, as I said before, it's very intuitive. It's not hard to understand. I think it was also a nice task to do together, like building a bridge was kind of nice doing it together. And also, I think I already said we have a similar working style. So we discussed first and then we...

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: build our bridge so i think it was um i think we worked pretty well so you thought we were on the same page during the building task yeah okay um was there a particular moment when you really clicked and like collaboration really worked or when was there a moment when you had trouble getting through to the other maybe it's a silent task yeah exactly yeah i was about to say that in

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: the silent task because in the first task we kind of agreed on how a bridge should look like and like what is an okay like okay amount of error and okay amount of improvisation and like just accepting things as they are so in the second task we could just easily build the bridge and everyone knew

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: what was to do so i think this was like most in flow yeah the second one was really like if everything worked perfectly because also i think and we knew we had time pressure So we try to be as organized as possible. I think that was actually very nice.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So when it comes to your working styles, do you think you contributed equally? Did you think one of you contributed more than the other one who took the initiative?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I think it was equally. I think it was quite equally, yes. It was all, I think, tasks. I mean, I think in the end, I think you made more suggestions regarding what to use.

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: I mean, also, we were kind of forced to contribute more or less equally because sometimes your heads didn't work, sometimes mine didn't work. So we had to distribute the work equally. And to be honest, I don't remember like who came up with the initial idea of the bridge. But like after we had this concept of what a bridge looked like, I think there was not much conceptual work to do anymore. It was it was all done. Yeah.

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I think we came up together, actually. So that was actually a nice process.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Yeah. And then last question, I guess, is if you were going to build another bridge together tomorrow, what's one thing you'd want to do differently?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: Is there anything?

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: I liked our bridge, actually,

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: because it was not pricey. It was easy.

\*\*jFYQhuSp\*\*: It's a very efficient design. So maybe one could sit down and think a lot more if it... can be even more efficient and more stable but i think with the parts we had um this was kind of a good bridge yeah yeah i agree i don't know if i would change anything okay any any other questions notes comments things you want to say to the other one in front of the microphone thank you for your collaboration okay thank you so much
