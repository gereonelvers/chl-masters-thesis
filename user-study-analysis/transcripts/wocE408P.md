\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thanks for taking the time to do the user study today. To start things off, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I think it was quite interesting and yeah, I was excited to build a bridge with the HoloLens because I have a bit experience with virtual reality glasses, but not with the AR ones. So it was interesting to see how it works and yeah, fun to explore it.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular moment where you felt particularly frustrated or something you particularly enjoyed? Anything that stood out?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I didn't feel frustrated, but I enjoyed it when I think about the second or third round. It works with your partner, so you know what you're building and you know what you have to do.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So was there a particular variant of the task that stood out? Was it just through time you got better? Is there one of the variants that particularly stands out?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I don't know, because the first one was without restrictions. So it was good to explore the possibilities and to practice. And then it was no problem with the time constraints. So yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. How do you feel about your performance? And how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I think it was quite nice. I liked our bridge, yeah. And I know him. We work a lot together. We are colleagues. So I know what he can do the best. And yeah, I think we made a good performance.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the task? Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I think it was... clear. Sometimes we made jokes about each other, but no,

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: it was respectful. And do you feel that your personality or maybe your previous experience played any role in how you collaborated?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: Yes, because I know him and if I decide how we do it, it's easier. Yes.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: What do you mean?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: If I say, okay, I take the blocks and you take the planks, it's easier for him. He can just do it and we don't have to discuss. And he's always fine with such things.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So would you say then that you adapted to the other's working style?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: Yes, because normally I wouldn't take the choice every time.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel mentally overloaded at any point?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: No, because I'm comfortable with the glasses.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And then just overall, how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different variants?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I think it was quite difficult when we weren't allowed to talk. But it was our third round, I think. So we, yeah, had the chance to practice before. And yeah, I think the other task with the cost restrictions and the stability ones, yeah, that's quite difficult.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Is there anything else you want to get done on the record? Any other comments, questions, anything else you want to get transcribed?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I'm sorry.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Then thank you so much.
