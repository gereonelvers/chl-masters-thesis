\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thanks for doing the user study today with me. I hope you at least had some fun doing it. Just a couple of questions and then you're done. So as a first starting off question, I guess, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: It was more fun than I expected. Just interacting with another human being made the user study, you know, much more engaging, much more... The time passed really fast. Yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: What are any moments you particularly enjoyed or where you felt particularly frustrated? Can you describe them?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: Frustrated at the beginning because the thing wasn't calibrating, but once I got the hang of it, you know, and I accepted the flow, the process flow, it was very, very easy. And at the end, it was very satisfying when me and my partner did a record time and yeah, I needed to say that.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there then a particular variant of the of the task that really stood out as being memorable in any way.

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: Well, you know, actually the fact of making a bridge since this particular thing wasn't, it's not in my background, you know, and it was outside of my comfort zone 100% and combined with HoloLens it was definitely something new for me.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So then how do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: Oh, at the beginning it wasn't as spectacular, it was, the first bridge was very cumbersome. you know it it won't resist any wind you know so but uh the performances afterwards were pretty nice yeah i'm i'm pretty happy with it and also felix was amazing uh we collaborated very very well although we didn't know each other um so how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the tasks uh very efficient uh we we had no extra conversations you know it was exactly on point we agreed very fast and i think this is also because we trusted each other's instincts so it was good did it differ between the variants sorry did it differ between the variants uh the communication style probably at the beginning it was also that muted challenge you know so it was and we also didn't know each other so it was pretty how should I say, hard. It was

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: it was more politeness there you know but at the end of the day we agreed very fast on some strategies and it was the best um did you feel that your personality or your previous experiences played a role in how you collaborated yeah i think i'm a very open

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: person you know when somebody expresses an opinion to me and their opinion is better i can accept that and i go with it yeah um

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Then did you adapt to your partner's working style? Did your partner's working style adapt to you? How did that go?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: So the way it works, a person says at the beginning a strategy, and if I agree with it, I go with that. And if not, I have something to say. And luckily, also the partner was very open to communication. I think it all went for the better.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel mentally overloaded at any point? If so, where?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: At the beginning. I felt that the task wasn't the most comfortable for me. So probably I was feeling like I should make a very complex bridge or something, you know, but at the end of the day is solving some tasks.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: Once you get the hang of it, it's very easy. So it was very, yeah, nothing too challenging, but it was fun.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, are there any other thoughts, opinions, sentences you want to get into the microphone right now?

\*\*YeUp7E4D\*\*: It was very fun, so I enjoyed it. Thanks for including me here, you know.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much.
