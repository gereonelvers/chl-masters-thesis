STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CORRECTIONS
===============================

ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
- One-way ANOVA used: F = 5.523, p = 0.004
- This is INVALID due to repeated measures (non-independence)
- Each dyad contributes 4 data points, violating independence assumption

CORRECTED ANALYSIS:
- Friedman test (repeated measures): χ² = 12.750, p = 0.005
- Kruskal-Wallis test (robust): H = 10.213, p = 0.017
- Effect size (eta-squared): 0.372
- Equal variances assumption: Violated (p = 0.024)

PAIRWISE COMPARISONS (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests):
Open Ended vs Timed: W = 7, p = 0.148
Open Ended vs Silent: W = 6, p = 0.109
Open Ended vs Roleplay: W = 6, p = 0.109
Timed vs Silent: W = 12, p = 0.461
Timed vs Roleplay: W = 0, p = 0.008
Silent vs Roleplay: W = 2, p = 0.023
