\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: It's a partner interview. Yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Ah. Yeah. So after you've just done the individual interviews, I just want to get your thoughts when you're in the same room together just to see if you can say maybe different things, same things. Let's see what comes up. So how was the experience for the two of you? Anything surprising? Anything memorable? Did you like it?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: We should start or doesn't matter?

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: No, just whoever. Just start talking.

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: So literally I'm going to repeat it like in front of him?

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Yeah.

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: Okay. Yeah. I can start. as i said already it was at some point very frustrating um like the blocks didn't align the way i wanted to have them um i would say this is like the most memorable thing but i think as i said also before i think our work together worked well from my perspective um yeah i would agree like working together was good um

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: everyone had ideas and bringing them up sometimes we had kind of a productive discussions like yeah um even in the task with the um where you should focus on the on the money and the structure um and yeah sometimes i guess you had more you you looked more in detail like if there was a small gap between the blocks um where i would say yeah okay it's maybe just technical thing and you were sitting there and trying to to move the blocks

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: for a few millimeters um which sometimes worked and sometimes not um but yeah overall it was i would say good um so you felt you were on the same page during the building tests yes maybe what one more thing i just realized i didn't say it in the first interview i think we kind of checked each other as well i think i checked your blocks and you checked mine which is i guess quite positive because you looked at mine and wasn't in the end you said i showed that if they're together and i went also two years and put them slightly together so true i think we did first we did our own task and then kind of checked without like actually talking about it yeah cool was there any moment when you had trouble getting through to the other one what do you mean as you were trying to make a point and they just weren't getting it anything were you were having having trouble with working with the other one i think maybe in the beginning when we were talking about our ideas because we didn't have the blocks placed there yet and we because we had the time constraint one so we were trying to show like with our hands where to place the blocks um since we couldn't move them there i think it was a little bit more difficult but it worked i

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: feel like it worked okay um do you feel that one of you contributed more than the other one who have you took the initiative more

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: I feel like I started most of the time, but I think we contributed equally. As I said in our interview already, that, for example, you came up with the idea that we place the blocks on the floor, like in a straight line to make it as cheap as possible and safe as possible. But I wasn't like entirely convinced in the beginning because for me... in my head which looks different it has to be like high up in the air but for example i agreed with you on that one and so i guess we kind both agreed like and also like when we had the task where i had to focus on money on the structure um everyone had like his idea but we communicated it and worked out well

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: i would say no same like i would say that max started most of the time with like his ideas um

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: and then i followed him but it wasn't it wasn't still on the same level um okay um and then second to last question is um if you were going to build another bridge tomorrow if you were doing this again tomorrow um what's one thing you'd want to do different exact same setup same thing just you're doing this thing again tomorrow what is there anything you want to do differently if so what

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: maybe if it's possible to have a better description of the task, like what is allowed and what is not allowed. Because one time where we put all the small blocks just on the side, we weren't sure if it's allowed or not. I mean, the task was very open. So we said, OK, if it's allowed, then we can do it. But for building the bridge, I wouldn't do anything different, I would say.

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: Yeah, I agree with his point that it would be nice to have like a clear definition of what is a bridge. That would, I would say, help me a lot to second guess myself. Other than that, maybe see my results from today to see if the blocks are together or not.

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: Maybe also for the structure.

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: Yeah, so like just see if we fucked something up. in order to know if we have to approach it a different way.

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: Yeah, maybe also not only better description of the task, also better description of what is the best bridge, like how do we measure it? But yeah, which is kind of more task description thing. okay um any other thoughts ideas sentences you want to say into the microphone maybe one one thing which i had um outside um i mean maybe it's more something for study but um building the the bridge on the floor was sometimes a bit strange

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: or i don't know like sitting on the floor and trying that maybe to do it on the desk for me i felt very familiar because i felt like a small max like

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: building yeah and i was like sitting on the floor always like building legos yeah true but yeah i get what you mean i get what you mean i mean maybe for also for like workers who are i don't know 20 30 40 years old um maybe there's something to do it on the table maybe in the air something like that but fair point okay that's it thank you so much
