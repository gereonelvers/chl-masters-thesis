\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thank you so much for taking the time to do the user study. I hope you had at least some amount of fun. As a short intro, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: Sure. So I think overall it was a very smooth experience. The tasks were well explained and I think it was always quite clear what the objective was, especially because it was repeated before each task and the specific nature of the tasks was highlighted. yeah, I think in general the working together with my collaborator went quite smoothly, and I think we were quite aligned on what we would do, not much discussions on that, and I think we always came to an outcome that was quite satisfactory.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, what are moments that you particularly enjoyed? Are you particularly frustrated? Can you describe them?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: So I think, I mean of course the more you do the tasks, the more kind of you get into it and the easier it becomes and that's kind of a part of the enjoyment I guess of doing this kind of thing especially because I'm not really used to doing anything with AR I think it's fun to kind of in the beginning you don't really understand what it what it's like and then you kind of get into it um I think what was maybe not so um and or what I enjoyed not so much was when sometimes you would pick up the blocks and then maybe they would like just slightly misalign because I'm very much like in things like that a perfectionist where I wanted to like perfectly align so it's always nice when it does that but maybe a bit annoying when it doesn't and was there a particular variant of the task that stood out positively

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: or negatively

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I mean I think the time constraint one is kind of fun because it makes it a bit more gamified maybe because you know you're kind of competing against something otherwise or actually the the two ones that were maybe a bit more competition was the one against the time and the one maybe against the other but i think in this case we kind of collaborated more in the end instead of trying to yeah get our objective fulfilled

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: so yeah okay um and when now across all of the variants how do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I think we did overall quite well with regards to, I mean, it depended a bit on the task, but I think overall we did quite well with the time. I think in the first two tasks, we were both not really good at keeping the cost in mind, but that was me and my partner. Yeah, so I would say we did a similarly good slash bad job in certain things. Yeah, overall, still, I'm quite satisfied with the result.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And how would you describe your communication style with your partner? Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I think it did differ. I mean, of course, in the first variant, we didn't talk to each other at all. In the second, I think we weren't super good at communicating because we would more say little snippets of words that maybe weren't really meaningful. And then I think maybe it got more meaningful with time because we started... really noticing the objectives more especially when we were assigned specific tasks to focus on certain aspects i think um yeah we focus better on those aspects um so do you feel that your personality or maybe your previous experiences in whatever way um played any role in how you collaborated um i mean it for sure had an influence that we already knew each other um so yeah the Knowing my collaborator definitely had an influence, but I don't have really any experience with AR or I'm also not a full engineer, so I don't think that my experience otherwise really had an impact.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you adapt your working style to your partner or did your partner adapt their working style to you at all?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I think it was very much mutual. I think we both kind of adapted to each other. I mean, of course, it wasn't just one person doing their thing.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: thing and then the other just adapted I think it was very collaborative okay um and then did you feel mentally overloaded at any point no I wouldn't say so um no

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I think I mean I think it's what was nice is that it was not like the information given was not overwhelming you have the clear sets of blocks that you have and a clear yeah kind of clear objectives as I said before and also I think because the kind of setup maybe doesn't change too much between the tasks it's not too overwhelming maybe if it was very different from task to task and that would change.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions then? Is it the same difficulty all the time or was one of the variants more difficult?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: I would have thought maybe the time constraint one could be the more difficult, but then because it was our last one, I think the time constraint one could be difficult if it's maybe your first one and you don't really know how it works yet. But then in our case, it wasn't maybe the most difficult one. I think maybe the if you're not communicating at all and it was our first variant, it was maybe a bit weird. I think that was also the one that didn't turn out the best. I would say that was most challenging.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Is there anything else you want to get into the microphone? Any other questions, comments, anything else?

\*\*uTSV9lZx\*\*: No, I mean, overall, I think all the elements were integrated very well, as I said, very straightforward task description and communication. So yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, cool. Thank you very much.
