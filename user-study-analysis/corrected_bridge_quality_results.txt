CORRECTED BRIDGE QUALITY ANALYSIS RESULTS
==========================================

ORIGINAL PROBLEMS:
- Used one-way ANOVAs on repeated measures data (independence violation)
- Ignored dyadic dependencies
- Did not properly handle failed attempts

CORRECTED METHODS:
- Friedman tests for repeated measures
- Fisher's exact test for completion rates
- Proper effect size calculations
- Assumption checking

KEY FINDINGS:
- safety_factor: Friedman χ² = 4.062, p = 0.255
- von_mises_stress: Friedman χ² = 3.200, p = 0.362
- displacement: Friedman χ² = 2.288, p = 0.515
- price: Friedman χ² = 3.120, p = 0.373

COMPLETION RATE ANALYSIS:
- Timed variant completion rate: 75.0%
- Other variants completion rate: 100.0%
- Fisher's exact test: p = 0.056
