\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thanks for taking the time to do the user study with me. Just some general thoughts and then I'll let you go. So can you just briefly share your overall experience with the test today?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: It was nice. Also a bit fun. Like, it was more like playing with blocks instead of like working or trying to learn something. Sometimes I had the feeling that, I guess it's more from the technical side, that I saw some gaps in the blocks where Max didn't see them all the way around. And also sometimes you can move the blocks for just a few millimeters, and sometimes just in centimeters. So I guess it's more like a technical thing. But overall, it was kind of fun and very interesting.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Were there any particular moments you particularly enjoyed or where you felt frustrated? Can you describe what happened?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: So, I mean, there was kind of a happy moment where you were happy when you fulfilled a task. Maybe not in the first round with the time thing. And then sometimes it was kind of frustrating when you couldn't move the blocks. as you want or when you move the blocks as you want and it doesn't work.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular variant of the task that stood out? Was it particularly interesting, frustrating, fun, whatever?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: I mean sometimes there was a challenge like just have the time, five minutes or be as cheap as possible like that. But aside from that... things that I didn't see any difference in the tasks.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How do you feel about your performance, and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: I wouldn't say that there was a big difference. I guess the partner was sometimes more on details. Like, there was a small gap where I would say, OK, it's maybe some technical issues. He tried to align the blocks again. But I was satisfied with both performances.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How would you describe your communication style with your partner? Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: I guess we were both very productive and efficient. Like, no. we both want wanted to know what we have to do and how we want to do and even had good discussions about about our plans so yeah um

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: did you feel that your personality or maybe your previous experiences played a role in how you collaborated

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: I mean, previous experience over the tasks, you have more experience with the whole setup. So for sure, then at the end, you have more experience and you can work with it better.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So how do you think about communication? How well did you and your partner communicate? And did you adapt to each other's working styles at all?

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: i think the communication was good um so we we always let the other partner like think about his or say uh talk about this thought and even discuss on it but on a i would say it on a productive level so yeah um do you feel mentally overloaded at any point if so when um maybe at the beginning at the first um in the first seconds where you start with it because you don't know where what

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: is and how things works but after that oh um and how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions

\*\*kHxWHBLy\*\*: I wouldn't say that there were different levels of difficulty. It was more like we had different tasks, but maybe the time limited things was more difficult.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: yeah maybe that was a bit more difficult than the rest okay do you have any other thoughts comments uh ideas anything else you want to share um oh okay thank you for your time
