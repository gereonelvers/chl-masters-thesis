\*\*Interviewer\*\*: so okay um so thanks for just taking the couple of last couple minutes do the um debrief discussion here um so just overall um now that we're all in the same room together here um how was that for you anything that was surprising or memorable?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: side um yeah i was surprised we worked quite well together. No, I liked our bridge. We do it.

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: I think it was also very good that we aligned our performance, our expectations on this experiment. 

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: Four times the same bridge. 

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So did you feel you were on the same page during the building task?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: Yeah. 

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: Yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And was there like a particular moment when it really clicked for the both of you or when you had trouble getting through to the other one? Anything memorable? Or did you just start off being fine and end up being fine and always been fine?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: I think we started being fine and ended up being fine, but one moment was when we said, okay, the same like before, and everyone was here the same like before. And this was the moment, I would say.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, across all of the four variants, who have you contributed more? Who took the initiative more? Or was it very equally?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: i would say it was equally distributed yeah

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: i think you are more in the details 

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: yeah i'm definitely more into details yeah okay

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: um and then last question if you were going to build another bridge to uh together tomorrow what's the one thing you want to do differently?

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: like our bridge they would do it same bridge

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: same bridge but we have to stick better in our roles

\*\*wocE408P\*\*: yeah

\*\*kDp3Cy37\*\*: okay any other questions comments anything you want us to say
