\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so thanks for doing the user study today. Thanks for taking the time. As a short intro question, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: I liked it a lot. It was super impressive. Seeing like, or sampling this bridge. I had a good time sampling, or with this sampling task.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: What are any moments you particularly enjoyed, or where you felt particularly frustrated? Can you describe them?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: Not particularly frustrated, but sometimes it didn't work out the way I wanted it to. But besides that, the frustration levels were quite low, I'd say.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular variant of the task that stood out? So you did four variants. Is one of them... Oh yeah,

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: like the competitive one. I mean, it was competitive in my opinion, like building the bridge as quickly as possible. That's what I really liked. But also the last one was quite nice. I mean, we made it to a challenge.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: When you say the competitive one, you mean the timed one or the one where you were competing with your partner?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: No, the one with the time constraint.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. And then how do you feel about your performance? And also how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: I think we were aligned pretty good. We found a pretty good solution. I'm not sure if this was the intended solution, but I mean it was... It met all requirements, the put like that, and we could recycle it for different variants. So yeah. and I feel like the collaboration also worked well, especially towards the end. You could see that we performed as a team and not as individuals.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the task? Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: I mean, I'd say it became better with the understanding of the system, because we could align or we could basically distribute tasks. And I mean, verbal communication was good in the beginning, but nobody really knew what, you know, where it's going to go. But, you know, we basically knew what we want to build and we had like a goal in mind where we communicated based on which communication.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And then did you feel that your personality or previous experience played any role in how you collaborated?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: I mean, of course, teamwork. is something you need to learn. But I wouldn't say that my previous experience really stood out for this sample test.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Did you or your partner at all adapt to the other's working style?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: Yeah. I think we are similar, but we...

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: collaborated well especially in the end um and did you feel mentally overloaded at any point if so when not really okay and then how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions um i

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: feel like it was always the same and to be honest same environment um same task basically just a slightly different setting um Yeah, so same complexity.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Do you have any other questions, thoughts, comments, anything else you want to get down on the record?

\*\*OYYOwkG2\*\*: I love the application, honestly. Well done, well done.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, then thank you so much.
