\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much for taking the time to do the user study today. I hope you had at least some amount of fun. As a quick intro, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: In the beginning, I was a bit frustrated with the bricks and all the stuff falling apart. But I learned that I got quite confident at the end of the task. And using the AI or the VR goggles was not... the challenge at the end anymore but on the first trial it was challenging um what are moments you particularly enjoyed or you felt particularly frustrated can you can you describe uh yeah when we had like this time constraint and our bridge was not um properly assembled i was frustrated yeah um was

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: that then the particular task variant of the forward that stood out the most or was there another one that stood out uh either positively or negatively yeah i liked the one where we had no constraints um

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: that stood out positively and the time constraint for the second task was a bit annoying.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, then how do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: I realized that my partner was rather interested in building the same bridge over and over again. I was more interested in trying out new things and new stuff and maybe I took the wrong decision at the wrong task.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: to try out something new during the time restricted task that was maybe not the best idea but i was also um clear that this was my fault so and apart from that i think collaboration worked quite well okay and how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the task and also did it differ maybe between the variants i think we

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: communicated quite efficiently um we're not talking too much but we talking necessarily um yeah or talking about necessary stuff and between the variants i think that that was more or less the same for all the variants did

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: you feel then that your personality or maybe your previous experience played any role in how you collaborated with your partner so to be honest i have previous experience with autodesk inventor and crd modeling but i

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: thought to not like i don't know over engineer it now because i wanted to have fun and collaborate with my partner and since i knew that she has no background i just wanted to keep it as simple and easy as possible and like building a bridge you don't need like in this style you don't need auto disk knowledge so i was not um i was not drawing on i'm not um using my prior knowledge and i thought it's more fun to just randomly assemble a bridge without any knowledge here

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: um so did you get the feeling that you adapted your usual working style to your partner or do you think she adopted uh that adapted her working style to yours i think i didn't adopt much of my style because i think or i would say that i'm rather communicative

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: and also i have an idea and once i have this idea i communicate it straightforward and um yeah I think I still try to be polite all the time and also listen to her ideas, but I think I have like a strong opinion on how we could do something and then also communicate this opinion.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Switching gears, did you feel mentally overloaded at any point?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: No, not mentally overloaded.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions? Is there one that was more difficult? Is there an order to them?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: I felt that the task was more or less the same. So there were a few more red blocks in the later tasks, but they were not affecting us in our style or way to build the bridge.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Is there anything else you want to get into the microphone at this point? Any other questions, comments, feedback, anything else you want to get on the record?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: No, that's all.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Thank you so much.
