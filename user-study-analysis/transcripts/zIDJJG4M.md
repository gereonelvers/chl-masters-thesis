\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much for taking the time to do the user study. Just a couple more questions, then a quick debrief discussion and then we're about done. So as a short intro, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: It was a lot of fun. I liked it a lot. Yeah, it was cool. The app was well developed. Everything worked, no technical problems. So yeah, all good.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Cool. Were there any moments you particularly enjoyed or where you particularly felt frustrated?

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: I was very frustrated with the fact that I didn't know whether I would have to also do the same task the other way around. Because in the collaboration, I thought to myself the whole time, yeah, I behave different if I would know whether or not we do the same thing again after. Yeah, that. I think that was a frustrating thing. But in the end I think overall it was good, it was fun.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So was that the particular task variant that stood out the most or was that one of the other variants that really stood out?

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: In frustration definitely the one where you felt like you had a conflicting interest. In fun I think the one where there were completely no limitations. that was nice yeah i i do also enjoyed the silent one but it might have been just because it was the last one it felt like okay now we don't have to talk we can just build yeah okay and how do you feel about your performance across all the four variants and how about your partner's performance i think we did all right i think we we focused quite a bit on um low cost maybe we focused a bit too much on low cost um it was also hard because there's no requirements so there's no way to have any indication of whether you should focus on strength or not um yeah uh but aside from that i think we did it honestly like i think it was pretty smooth um partners performance in general good

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: of course when we had the conflicting interests then it was conflicting but for the rest it was good okay um and how would you come describe your communication style with your partner during the task did it differ between the variants yeah because we weren't allowed to talk in one of them so

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: that was a non that was a non-verbal one there we just communicated very little and just built i think um Communication was very different, of course, where you had the conflicting interests. I think both of us, we were extremely task-focused on our own interests, not so much about any of the other ones, hence the huge time it took for us to consense. Yeah, I think that, I think for the rest, it was pretty collaborative. I think she put ideas in that we used and I put ideas in that we used. So I think in general, that's okay. So far, so good. okay um do you feel that your personality or maybe your previous experience played any role in how you collaborated yeah for sure like like especially like i think in general in the collaboration part the most interesting one is the condition where we're competing because in the other ones the collaboration went smooth like communication was was there in the one where we're competing that's a bit more common and i because like i have had like a lot of group projects and as a phd now like for three years i'm working with students already and there's always going to be a point where there's conflicting interest between them so i have like just some like problem solving skills there right um and like i think that that helps yeah um

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: and did you feel that you or your partner uh adapted to the other's working style so did you change how you would usually collaborate with someone or did she do that yeah oh but i think that

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: that's an like yeah i think that for it to have good collaboration both of you should sort of converge to a mutual understanding and we did that um in the beginning but this is a tendency of mine and especially my personality i tend to take the lead on it so in the beginning i very much took the lead um but then i sort of realized that a bit and then she gave in suggestions and then we took quite a bit of that too and then i thought okay like that's decent collaboration i think it helps that her personality is also pretty pretty as an understatement quite outspoken and that helps a lot because maybe if she wouldn't have been outspoken

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: it would have just been me dominating through the whole thing which is a pitfall of my personality um did you during any of the variants at any point feel mentally overloaded overloaded

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: not but definitely the one where we were had competing interest was definitely the most loaded it was like i don't know if it's because of like mental load i don't necessarily no but just in general overloaded because like it's a lot on the collaboration like there's a lot on the like you have different task groups like this is the first time that you really have a task where you're told okay this is what you focus on so yeah but it was do you think task order played a role there yeah i think it could have ended so i think we did a second the one we competed if that would have been first or last it would have been very different so if it was first then i'd have thought okay the whole time we're going to have this and then you have to be way cautious in like in what you're doing if it was the last then you know it's the last and then you know like the likelihood of each other over is i think way hard higher in that part um so i think definitely it plays a role in that also I think that the other tasks would have gone less smooth if this one was later. I think because we had conflict there and we were already comfortable then conflicting with each other, in the other ones, if we didn't agree, we could more easily just handle it because we showed in the second one that we were able to handle it.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And just in general, how would you compare then the difficulty of the task across the different conditions?

\*\*zIDJJG4M\*\*: i think it's the same i think the difficulty to me the difficulty was about the same like sometimes we had a bit of a different objective like once we did we went for a bridge that's a bit stronger like this kind of stuff but in general i think it's about okay anything else you want to get done on the record any questions comments feedback anything else you want to say into the microphone and get onto the record um i liked it like it was like i said it inside i think it was really fun um And... yeah like mainly that like it was it was it was a smooth view study it was well well designed um so yeah nothing to add I think okay thank you so much
