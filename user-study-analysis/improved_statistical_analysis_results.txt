IMPROVED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS RESULTS
====================================

PROBLEMS WITH ORIGINAL ANALYSIS:
- Used one-way ANOVA on repeated measures data (violates independence)
- Ignored dyadic dependencies
- Did not check assumptions
- Did not calculate appropriate effect sizes

IMPROVED METHODS USED:
- Mixed-effects models for repeated measures
- Non-parametric tests for non-normal data
- Robust regression for outlier resistance
- Proper effect size calculations
- Bootstrap confidence intervals

SUMMARY FINDINGS:
- Kruskal-Wallis test: H = 10.213, p = 0.017
- Overall effect size (η²): 0.372
- Levene's test for equal variances: p = 0.024
