\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much for doing the study today. Thanks for taking the time. To start things off, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I think it was a fun task, fun experience. The system was fairly straightforward to learn and use.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Were there moments that you particularly enjoyed or where you felt particularly frustrated? Can you describe them?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I felt particularly frustrated when the blocks were moving in directions that I didn't want them to move to, which I felt I had a bit of trouble with, especially not being very used to using the pointer. I felt like I was using my body a lot going down and up to try to turn the tool, the blocks. I think if I had more experience in handling this then maybe it would have been less physical and more. by movement of the hand. Things that I particularly enjoyed were the little features like that the blocks aligned automatically. I think that was nice. Sometimes that led to more confusion with the blocks, but most of the time it worked well.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular variant of the task of the four that you did that stands out in a good or negative way?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I think the silent one was fun, especially because it was the first one. So that was a funny outcome.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I feel that we both performed very well, except maybe in the first task.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. How about you describe your communication style with your partner during the task? Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: Yes, I think in the last one where there was time pressure, we were much more concise in our... communication while in the second task where we allowed where we were allowed to talk as much as we wanted to had as much time as well we didn't have as much time as we wanted but we felt like we did because there wasn't a countdown there we were much more goofy and i also enjoyed that in the third task since each had their assigned um goal in mind um i think we managed to build a a better and more stable bridge because one person was each responsible for one of the things we needed to keep in mind.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Do you feel that your personality or previous experience played any role in how you collaborated?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: Maybe. How so? I mean we're good friends so I think that makes it easier to maybe understand what the other person is trying to say or do.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So do you feel that you adapted?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: to your partner's working style do you think they adapted to yours um i think it was mutual also i think i was trying to be considerate and i felt that so did she um did you feel mentally overloaded at any point when the blocks were not turning the way i wanted them to turn to

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: And how would you compare the difficulty of the task across the different conditions?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: I think the silent one was definitely the first, the hardest one, but maybe because it was the first one. I think maybe not in general. I think after that maybe the time pressure was the hardest.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Is there anything else you want to get into the microphone at this point? Any questions, comments, anything else you want to add?

\*\*iB6kR2uo\*\*: That's fine.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, cool. Thank you so much.
