\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, so, thank you so much for taking the time to do the tasks. I hope you had at least some fun. So for the first question, could you just briefly share your overall experience with the tasks today?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I think my experience was good. It was a fun task. I think also the difficulty was not too high, so it was possible to do the task and move the partner. I mean, it got always harder. each level because it was already hard not to speak but then I think the last part was hardest because then we had different interests as well so yeah but overall my experience was very good um were there any moments you particularly enjoyed or any time you really felt frustrated can you describe them I think I enjoyed the task in the whole but there was not like one moment where I enjoyed it fully or like more than other times I think in the end I was more a bit frustrated because it was like hard especially like if you have small pieces to align them correctly but I think that's it I mean I wasn't really frustrated but that was like the most difficult part I guess.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular task variant that stood out in any way?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: What do you mean like standing out the task?

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Standing out as being particularly memorable.

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: Not really, no.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. How do you feel about your performance? And how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I think we both made a very good job. I liked how we worked together and how we aligned. I mean, of course, in the last condition, it was harder. But still, I think we did a good job. And I'm happy with my performance and also with Mia's performance.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How would you describe your communication style with your partner during the tasks?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: did differ between variants um i would say it was pretty similar because we both made suggestions and um in the end collaborated it was not like one person told the other person what to do it was more like i would suggest to do that and that and then the other person said oh yeah okay or not and um i think both of us made say like suggestions and yeah i think it was pretty similar yeah did you feel that your personality or

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: previous experience played a role in how you collaborated?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I would say that I'm a social person so I think it was not like oh yeah we have to do that so I think maybe that kind of influenced how we collaborated but Niels was the same like I think we both had a similar interest and my experience before I think didn't really influence how I acted. Because I just wore it once in another experiment, so I think there's no big influence.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you or your partner have to adapt to each other's working styles? Did you adapt to each other's working styles at all?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I feel like we had a promo... a very similar working style so we first talked about how we want to do it and then we did it and also we kind of worked on our parts and then we like combined like for example in the middle and um yeah i think we had a similar working style okay

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: um did you feel mentally overloaded at any point if so when i think maybe in the last condition but maybe just because it was the last one and it was already like

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: one and a half hours in so I think it I don't know if it was because we had different interests and it was not as easy as the first like tasks or if it was because of the time because it was yeah already spent a bit time here.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How would you compare the difficulty of the tasks across the different conditions?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: So it increased from low to high I would say.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, are there any other questions, comments, anything else you can say about the experience?

\*\*SAKl2Kyg\*\*: I think it was very interesting. I think you put a lot of thought into it and it was very intuitive. So I think everyone, if you have prior knowledge or not, can do it. Thank you so much.
