\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: Great.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the time to do the user study with me. My pleasure. I hope you've at least enjoyed it somewhat. I have a couple more questions, and then we're about them. So for the first question, can you just briefly share your overall experience with the task today?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: Yes. I think I thought it was really fun all in all. I had a lot of fun collaborating and also building the bridge. It was a bit challenging just because of the fact that the blocks could just fall as well. like if you built like a higher structure and you accidentally knocked it over it was knocked over you had to build it up again it was a bit uh yeah interesting in the first run but then in the second runs we adapted to that and it was more fun and easier so yeah great experience we'll do it again um what are any moments you particularly enjoyed or where you felt particularly frustrated can you describe them uh okay frustrated in the first run when i knocked over the bridge another the time because i think in the first round you need to get used to the uh yeah how the system reacts to you first so i accidentally pinched for example an object that i didn't want to pinch and then i moved it all over the way or through it and almost like and and really cool was then when we aligned on our strategy in the second and third run and then we were really quick about it and

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: managed to complete the whole thing very quickly yes was there any particular particular variant of the task so one of the four variants that particularly stood out as being better, worse, anything memorable there?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: I think the fact that the first time we had to perform it, we couldn't speak was quite challenging, because then we didn't have the chance at all to align on strategy. And once you do it, the next run is going to get way easier because you know, like what you could do and you explore possibilities and you think a bit smarter about it. And the first one, for example, I just started to execute a strategy that in retrospect wasn't the perfect one it was very lean but very complex or what very uh sensible to to my movement so um yeah but after that i think you improve so much from the first the second run as well and then third and fourth is really easy because you have done it twice or three times already okay okay um how do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance um i feel good definitely i think um we personally took some loopholes that um yeah maybe i don't know i'm happy with doing that because i always try to find the easiest possible way inside an environment. But yeah, I think our bridge would need to swim to work. No, I don't mean that. No, I think I'm very happy with my performance. I think with Petro it was nice in a way that he really quickly saw if I had an idea that was good to execute it as well. And we communicated very efficiently and it was really fun. yeah happy with my partner how would you describe your communication style with your partner doing the task i am in general very um efficient and quick um i think we aligned quickly on things and didn't argue a lot or actually not at all um i think he was really open to my ideas which i really liked so um yeah when i proposed the strategy nearly every time he just yeah went with it and it worked quite well so yeah i think it was quite efficient

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did it differ between the variants?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: I mean, the first one we couldn't communicate by speaking to each other. So we had to point and, I don't know, just arrange ourselves. So this was a bit different. And also, like, we didn't really have a perfect strategy there. But then I just started to execute mine and he also adapted to mine. So that was really nice.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel your personality or your previous experience played any role in how you collaborated?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: Probably the personality, yes. Previous experiences. Not really, as we don't really know previous experiences. So there wasn't this case of like, I think he's way more experienced. That's why I have to go with this style. But I'm like someone who really likes to just get started and just do and execute and don't really overcomplicate and makes things.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Yeah,

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: makes things more difficult that they need to be. So, yeah, in total, I... I think they, the two personalities aligned really well.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you or your partner adapt to each other's communications or working styles at all?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: I think yes, in a way. Like once Petro also saw that like I'm someone who just likes to get started and get things done, that he really aligned with that and didn't speak a lot and we just went for it.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Did you feel mentally overloaded at any point?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: I think in the first run, yes, in a way that... I needed to get used to that if I don't look at the object it will drop from my hand. So a lot of times I picked something up and I looked away and then it was not in my hand anymore. So this was a lot in the beginning and also like tipping over the bridge in the first run was a bit annoying. But I think really the learning effect was super quick. Like after the first run you really knew how the system works, you knew what you want to do and then you could just execute. And then like, yeah, it was very easy and very nice.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: So then how would you compare the difficulty of the task across different conditions?

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: I think the conditions don't really play as much a role as your experience in this. I think no matter what the condition in the second and third run, it's going to be easier in any way than in the first run because you just got used to the system. Still, I think the hardest combination is definitely not speaking and having not done it before. So this is definitely the hardest. And then I think the easiest is actually for me personally the time one because then you focus as well and you align and you just execute and yeah the role one was nice I think in a way that yeah I'm someone who really likes to find quick compromises and optimize for everyone and maximize value so

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: I think we did that really well and just execute it so yes okay um are there any other thoughts ideas opinions anything else you want to get into the microphone

\*\*WzyEiaaj\*\*: really quickly I think it was a really nice study we had a lot of fun it was well designed and I would actually say that I would do that in my free time because it was really fun and I think it could be a really cool team building experience as well so yeah props to Geryon

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Elvas okay well thank you thank you so much
