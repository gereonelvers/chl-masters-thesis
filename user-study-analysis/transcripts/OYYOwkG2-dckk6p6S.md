**Interviewer**: so okay um so thanks for just taking the couple of last couple minutes do the um debrief discussion here um so just overall - how was that for you? Anything that was surprising or memorable?

**OYYOwkG2**: I thought aligning the AR blocks would be clunky but once i got used to the controls it felt pretty smooth.

**dckk6p6S**: yeah i was surprised how intuitive it. Calibration sucked, but everything else was fine

**Interviewer**: So did you feel you were on the same page during the building task?

**dckk6p6S**: for the most part yeah. the silent variant made it awkward

**OYYOwkG2**: same here. i started pointing and nodding to show what i meant and we figured it out after a bit

**Interviewer**: And was there like a particular moment when it really clicked for the both of you or when you had trouble getting through to the other one? Anything memorable? Or did you just start off being fine and end up being fine and always been fine?

**OYYOwkG2**: it clicked in variant 2 when we laid down the things first - gave us a stable base right away

**Interviewer**: Okay, across all of the four variants, who have you contributed more? Who took the initiative more? Or was it very equally?

**dckk6p6S**: i’d say balanced. i placed parts, he placed them, it's fine

**OYYOwkG2**: yeah

**Interviewer**: and then last question if you were going to build another bridge to uh together tomorrow what's the one thing you want to do differently?

**OYYOwkG2**: i’d try building an actual bridge with height

**dckk6p6S**: hahaha

**Interviewer**: okay any other questions comments anything you want us to say

**dckk6p6S**: nah all good from my side

**Interviewer**: thank you so much
