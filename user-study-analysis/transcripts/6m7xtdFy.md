\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, cool. So thanks for taking the time to do the user study with me today. As a first question, can you just briefly reflect and share your overall thoughts on the experience or the task today?

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: So overall thoughts would be, I would say two main points. First one, it was kind of frustrating sometimes, like if the blocks didn't do what you actually wanted to do. If you have like a block, a physical block, you... literally place it it stays there it doesn't move anymore that didn't work or you couldn't lift up two blocks at the same time so you had like some constraints which could be very frustrating i would say and the second one i would say over the whole experiment i wasn't 100 sure if like what's the definition of a bridge for you because i think my definition is a different one than the one here and then we changed it like to line on the floor which wouldn't be a bridge in my perspective but it was a cost most cost effective one and apparently it is a bridge for me a bridge is it has a pole it has to lift up in the air and it's not like otherwise it would be a road kind of for me if you just place blocks next to each other um and it was still like every single time i question myself should we go for this method or should we just say yeah all right apparently this is a bridge and we go for the cheapest option of the easiest one which we did in the end

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: What are any particular moments that really stood out to you? Anything you really enjoyed where you felt really frustrated? Concrete moments. Can you describe any?

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: I would say I was surprised how good the collaboration worked between me and Leo. Because I thought there would be more disagreements. Since I think from his perspective it could be more stable with different blocks. But somehow he was very... cooperative and i think in the end i gave him also like three more cheap blocks like as a thank you in a way so i think that was a positive one that worked very well and i think the last task where we had to be silent i think we had the advantage that we kind of said yeah let's do round three again like with sign language and we didn't have to communicate actually which was easier for us and like the negative one i would say still frustrating sometimes um there wasn't like various particular moment but it's like all over the time again when it wasn't in the right spot the block and i would say first task was quite tough for us i think we would have performed much better if it would be in different order but i guess that's it and i think we lost time uh we lost to keep track of time uh actually if we looked at the time probably we couldn't manage to do it um but yeah was there a particular but

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: particular variant of the task that really stood out was very memorable do you have a favorite one least favorite what do you mean with variant you've done four variants okay okay okay so not the environment like literally yeah just just four variants four times you did the task is one of them your favorite least favorite anything that's memorable i

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: mean the last ones that i would say out the most because without talking i think it's very rare especially normalized you can probably talk beforehand discuss it and then start working you would never go into a fucking noisy hall and just say oh fuck i forgot about that let's do let's try it out so this was more in a negative way but i think we had like the as i said already we had like the easy scenario that we just repeated what we did before and positively i actually like the one where we had like two different tasks that i had to look for costs and uh Leo had to look for the like that it's constructed in a way that's stable because I think this is a scenario which will be there quite often even though you don't have it like in the AR environment but I think that was nice too that everyone has to focus on one aspect because I think that happens quite often in industrial settings.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: How happy are you? How do you feel about your performance and how do you feel about your partner's performance?

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: I think i would say our performance from me and leo was pretty same i would say i would rate it like this but i would say in the first task i was very annoyed at myself and kind of like not at leo but like that we didn't manage to build a bridge which was in my opinion very frustrating um and the rest i think we did a good job um hopefully everything turned out in all blocks aligned properly so that it's according to your definition of bridge which functions. I'm a little bit worried that there might be... one or two blocks not touching exactly and we couldn't see it with the hololenses and that's the reason why we it up we could have probably also played the safe card and place one block on top each other but then it would cost more so we went i think a little bit the

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: risky part or the risky risky track um how would you describe your communication style with your partner during the tasks and did it differ between the different variants yeah for sure it varied um i mean first First task we...

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: discussed a lot beforehand because we knew we have time pressure um then the last one obviously was also different because we couldn't communicate it also we basically copy and paste the task three and i would say task two and three was the one where we communicated the most um i guess two even more because we kind of had to discuss still um but in overall i would say the communication

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: was good uh i didn't feel like we had problems really getting did you feel that your personality or your previous experience played any role in how you collaborated i think yeah i do since

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: we are we have the same background i think that's very helpful um it was easier for us because we kind of i think we approach problems the same way especially like they're not really mechanical engineering but still there are some parts like statics we have them in mechanics as well the first semester so we kind of approached in the same way so i think that was helpful in our scenario that we have the same background yeah um did you at all adopt uh adapt to the other's working style or would you argue then i would say adapted i adapted to the idea of leo that we place it on the ground because before and i didn't want like before and for me my definition of a bridge is different and then i said yeah if you look at the costs and like the how stable it is and apparently this was allowed let's go for it and i think that was his idea so yeah um did you feel mentally overloaded at any point if so when first task i would say because of the time time pressure um i knew that i we had not enough time to finish it so that was definitely

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: the most challenging the rest was all right okay and then um in general how would you compare the difficulty of the different tasks um across the different conditions so time pressure is was for me like in our order was the time pressure definitely the hardest second

\*\*6m7xtdFy\*\*: hardest question i would say the discussion one because you had to yeah kind of Yeah, I would say the second one because you had to align on one bridge with two different goals. And then I would say task three was the next hardest and task four the easiest, but only because of the order. For example, I would switch tasks four with three. It would be harder to do the silent one because we did copy and paste. So we didn't have to think about anything at all. We just did it. That was the main reason.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay cool um do you have any other thoughts opinions ideas anything else you want to get into the microphone um no not really i'm good okay well thank you so much perfect
