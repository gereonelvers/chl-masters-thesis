\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay um final quick debrief and then we're about done once again thanks for taking the time um so um just overall across all variants we've been spending the last two hours building bridges um how was that for you anything surprising anything memorable you

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: first oh you first no you first it's gonna be a long interview like okay i can go um it was very fun the interface was really cool i really enjoyed it And yes, the collaboration was not the best in the second, but I think that it was also due to the fact that we know each other really well. So that was part of that.

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: Yeah. Like, like I said before, I really enjoyed it. I thought it was really fun to do. It was a little tricky that the objectives were so vague because it like there's no way like i mean this this is me right like i like to optimize things so like it'd be really nice if you could see sort of uh any sort of objectives uh so that you could scale and prioritize now we really couldn't i really think that we could have like it i'm very curious how other people have done it because our bridges i think were relatively weak but pretty efficient and fast um i'm really curious in general how that went um and like the second one was like it was fun like so i mentioned this in the previous interview i really wonder how it would have been if it was the last one that we did because then you know that it because it's the last one that you don't have to collaborate anymore after and then maybe you got like harder and maybe i said also it was the first one maybe you get softer because you don't like

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: uh know that yeah yeah and um this came up to my mind now it wasn't i didn't look at the cost so much like it wasn't so easy to uh understand which were was the cheapest and what what which weren't i didn't look at it that much maybe like if it was like more clear might be a number on the look

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: it would be easier to like watch the cost yeah i also did that much no so i didn't really check the total cost but from the start i was we were very conscious on what like on getting the cheap parts for instance right um and like for instance yeah like one of the first things was like do the calculation like in terms of cost per block which ones are the most optimal ones and this kind of stuff right yeah um did you feel on the same page during the building tasks except

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: for the one where we were told not to be on the same page i felt yeah i felt that in the um what was the the third one well no the one in which we weren't able to talk last one yeah no no no not that one the one with the in which we we use the l blocks yeah the big ones i thought that it wasn't the best choice but i felt like given that there was also a time limit it was the best choice to go along with what we were doing so we weren't like like um

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: completely on the same page about yeah yeah i need i think i yeah i think in general we managed pretty well and i think in terms of communication we were pretty on the same page yes even when the objective wasn't i think it

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: was relatively respectful and aside from the one blow off shaking the hands means nothing to you um was was it in a particular moment when like the collaboration between the two if you really clicked and really really worked out well or on the other hand was there a particular moment when it really didn't i'll go first no so um what really didn't click was when um we

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: made like a the agreement like okay we'll do it like that it's a good compromise and shake hands and then

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: Okay, I agree with you. It was a bit mean from my point of view. But on the other side, I had in my mind the structure of the bridge of the previous task that was pretty good with that type of blocks. But the red space was bigger and so it wasn't optimizing in that case. So I had in my mind the previous one. but then there was like a bit part of the block outside so i didn't like it that was the reason why i changed my mind i was expecting something similar to the piercestops yeah i understand

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: and it was pretty like bad the structure of the bridge yeah i thought it was interesting because maybe maybe we can just to settle it run a simulation for the physics with and without those things because in my in my mind it was super obvious like the weak point of the bridge is not there so by adding by adding more points like more more more um things All that's happening is that my metric is going down. and yours is not going up because it's going to be the same thing. Yeah, so I think we had like a misjudge there because like in my mind it was very obvious this is not improving in any way and then in your mind it is obvious okay it improves a bit and then it started clashing. I think that was that was the frustration but I think in general like because I'm also just for the good parts I think we had good communication throughout all the way. and i think like um it was nice that because sometimes i can be a bit dominating in this and you didn't really let that happen and i like that because for instance like you suggested oh maybe we used a different bracket or whatever and then that worked so i thought that was good

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: yeah okay um across all four variants once again um who have you took the initiative more often and who have you contributed more

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: I think that Tim initiated the task more often, started to use to build blocks and everything, maybe due to his personality and also to the fact that he was faster in taking the blocks and everything because he has more experience with this type of reality, like virtual reality stuff, and contribute, I don't know. Maybe you also. I don't know. I mean, in this type of things, I think that I am the one with less experience, so I'm trusting the other more. In this case, I was trusting you a bit more.

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: Yeah, I think regarding initiative, I think the first time, I very clearly took nearly all the initiative. I think after that, that sort of shifted and it was a bit more equal. I think because you asked overall, I think it was probably me who took more initiative because of that.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: but i think i think in general that after that it was pretty good and i think the contribution was pretty cool i don't see a big difference okay um and then if you were going to build another bridge tomorrow if you were doing this task again tomorrow um what's

\*\*Oa3Qww1v\*\*: one thing you'd like to do differently is there anything um i would like to use we use pretty much the same blocks without considering the big ones or the one with different like forms and so maybe i would like to think about how to use them because we focus only on some some part only some some on some type of blocks except from for the l big l but maybe i don't know i would have like chosen some different yeah i guess it depends a little bit on the

\*\*vzIDJJG4M\*\*: objectives like if all objectives and everything else were the same um I think it wouldn't be too different so what I would like to do if it was like a sort of like a challenge or whatever is be like we could build something way stronger where like if there was less limitation if it was like only time and structure for instance and not also cost then I think we could really build something. like really strong um and that would be fun um yeah and also i was thinking for the one that one where we were struggling with the middle we could have built around it and then you don't have to go up and don't have the long distance that's what i was sort of that like i was thinking at the moment that but then i thought of that and then i thought yeah but that's more material cost so i like that's why i didn't do it because my objective was cost but like i thought like okay we could just build the same thing turn it a little bit because for instance it never said um that you kind of that you have to go straight yeah like if this is the start of the bridge the block the block we could just build an exact block here and not hit that red thing but then for that to be strong you want to use like a lot of the cubes and then maybe that's a bit right yeah okay

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Is there anything else you want to get down on the record? Any other questions, comments, anything you still want to say? No, thank you. Okay. Thank you so much.
