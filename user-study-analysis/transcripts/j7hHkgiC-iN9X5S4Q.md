\*\*Interviewer\*\*: okay uh thanks for taking the time still to do a quick wrap up on this um so to start things off just overall um you've now built four bridges and you've completed all the variants how was it for you anything surprising anything memorable um i

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: had fun it was uh it was a fun task uh i hoped during the different tasks or between the tasks that they will change slightly but it was more or less the same so there were no more red or a few more red um obstacles but not affecting our way of building the bridge and i liked how we collaborated it was fun yeah same for me um i think it was in general a fun exercise um but

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: as i said when i now think about it um with the three factors that we should have kept in mind maybe we thought it's easier than it actually was to be successful um did you feel during

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: or all of the variants that you were on the same page while building the bridge?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: Yeah, that was like the one big thought I had when I decided to try out something new during the task, which was time-restricted. And I also felt sorry for this, but I didn't think that it would end up in a catastrophe, but it ended up in a catastrophe. So, yeah. Yeah.

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: I think apart from that, we were always on the same page. And I mean, I still went with it. I wasn't, when you suggested the idea, I wasn't like, no, no, no, let's not do that. It's just like, okay, let's just see. So I think we were normally on the same page, yeah.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Was there a particular moment at all where it like really clicked and you really felt like you were in the flow working with your partner? Or was there a moment where you had like real trouble getting through to the other one and you felt frustrated about that?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: or was it just very very okay when we had this negative learning about that changing plans didn't end up quite good or quite well we then again took like our initial plan with having the small t ones and then i think we were both working quite efficiently and and

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: confidently on our bridge but i think already in the first task i think that when we figured out oh that might work and it seems quite cost less costs intense and the stability is also fine. I think that we were actually quite in a good flow because we had a proper plan, like a proper vision. Yeah.

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: I also realized that first we tried to use like the small cubes and then our bridge was colliding all the time. And I think we were both a bit frustrated and thought this is going to happen all the time and that the VR and AR is super sensitive. like how you place the planks on the cubes. But once we figured out to just replace the small cubes by the t-bars, I think we both were in a good flow and a good mood because we realized that it isn't actually this sensitive and this hard to beliverage.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Across all of the four variants, who of you contributed more? And who of you took the initiative more? That's a mean question. Is there a clear pattern?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: I think in the end, you felt more comfortable just choosing and collecting all the materials we need. And I was the part taking them and putting them onto the bridge. But I think we also changed roles. So then sometimes you tried to put them onto the bridge and I collected or I chose them. So I think during the games, we also switched roles from time to time. So they were maybe task where you were a bit more present and I was rather exercising on just doing it and then we also change roles yeah I think so too

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: I mean yeah I thought it was quite nice that sometimes we had like different worlds we were like okay I'm pressing so that we generate new items and he's the one putting it down um yeah but I don't think that like overall there was a big difference in who was more.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: more assertive yeah okay um and then if you were going to build another bridge together tomorrow what's one thing you'd want to do differently is there anything i think we could just use our initial idea first idea and just make

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: it slightly more perfect by just really fitting them perfectly together uh without any gaps and then i think it's a good and stable bridge yeah and also think about the different factors um i think a bit more and make a plan before before

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: the timer or in general the game would start um like in the time be efficient um yeah

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, final question. Is there anything else you want to get into the microphone at this point? Any other questions, comments, notes, feedback, anything else you want to get on the record?

\*\*iN9X5S4Q\*\*: No, I said what I had to say.

\*\*j7hHkgiC\*\*: Yes, thank you.

\*\*Interviewer\*\*: Okay, thank you so much. Thanks.
